 **Polars** is both lazy and semi-lazy. It allows you to accomplish most of your work eagerly, similar to Pandas, but it also provides a sophisticated expression syntax that will be optimised and processed within the query engine.

- Polars' purpose is to deliver a lightning-fast DataFrame library that makes use of all available cores on your machine. Unlike dask, which attempts to parallelize existing single-threaded libraries such as NumPy and Pandas, Polars is intended from the ground up for parallelization of queries on DataFrames.

Polars goes to great lengths to:

1.   Reduce redundant copies
2.   Traverse memory cache efficiently
3.   Minimize contention in parallelism
