## **About Datatable**
Datatable is the premier package for manipulating large tabular datasets. Large datasets can be aggregated quickly, columns can be added/updated/removed with low latency, ordered joins can be made quickly, and file reading can be done quickly.<br><br>
Among the features we wish to compare pandas with datatable are:
1. Read file
2. Compute metrics of a column
3. Find unique count of a column
4. Groupby Aggregation
5. Sorting

## **Dataset**
The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hhs/health-insurance-marketplace?select=Rate.csv">Rate.csv</a>
