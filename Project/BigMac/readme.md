# **Introduction**
Welcome to our Python project where we will be comparing the use of three popular libraries: Koalas, PySpark, and Vaex. These libraries are widely used in the data science community for data manipulation and analysis. In this project, we will be exploring the strengths and limitations of each library by applying them to a specific dataset. Koalas is a powerful library that allows for easy data manipulation with a familiar pandas-like syntax. PySpark is a library that allows for efficient distributed data processing with the use of Spark. Finally, Vaex is a library that is known for its efficient handling of large datasets. Through this project, we will be comparing the performance and functionality of these libraries to see which one is the best fit for our specific use case. Let's dive in and see how these libraries compare!

Throughout this project, we will be analysing the libraries by performing the tasks below:
* Reading Dataset into Dataframe
* Data Preparation & Data Cleaning
* Visualization

# **About the Dataset** 

In this project, we will be analysing Airline Delay and Cancellation from year 2016 - 2018 obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yuanyuwendymu/airline-delay-and-cancellation-data-2009-2018?select=2018.csv). 

The dataset is collected by U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics by tracking the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers. Summary information on the number of on-time, delayed, canceled, and diverted flights is published in DOT's monthly Air Travel Consumer Report and in this dataset of 2016 flight delays and cancellations.

The dataset from the Kaggle are seperated to different csv files based on year of airline delay and cancellation. As mentioned before that we will be analysing the airline delay and cancellation from year 2016 - 2018, we download the three csv files for year 2016, 2017 and 2018 and then we combine them into a dataframe.
