<h1>Airline Delay in 2017</h1>

The data set was found at Kaggle, the “Airline Delay and Cancellation Data, 2009 - 2018” data set originally comes from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics, all flights are domestic, which means they only flights within the U.S.

Which is the busiest and most problematic airport/airline is the key question we ultimately hope to answer, and since there is no simple answer, this data set presents a wide range of issues and offers several approaches to solving them, allowing us to study it in a variety of ways.
