Koalas is a data science library that implements the pandas APIs on top of Apache Spark so that data scientists can use their favourite APIs on datasets of any size.The file will compare koalas and pandas to see which libraries are more efficient to use in the health insurance marketplace dataset. The following operations and visualisations will be used to perform the comparison:

  ‚óè Comparison between read CSV

  ‚óè Comparison between mean from one column

  ‚óè Comparison between bar chart

  ‚óè Comparison between counting of null values 

  ‚óè Comparison between calculation of numerical data

  ‚óè Comparison between histogram
